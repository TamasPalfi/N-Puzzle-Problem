# N-Puzzle-Problem
This project was written with Java in Fall 2018.

The main goal of this project was to create code that could solve the N-puzzle problem game which can be found [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).  The idea was to have the game present a current game board or in the documentation called a GameState, and solve the game from that point either showing each gameState from the beginning to correct/winning state or stating that that board is unsolvable.  The point was to have it completed using several different AI programs such as uninformed search methods as BFS and DFS, as well as with the A* search method (using [Manahattan Distance](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html) as the heuristic).
